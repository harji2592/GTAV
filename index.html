        <h1>Information</h1>
        <p>Rockstar North began to develop Grand Theft Auto V in 2008, around Grand Theft Auto IV's release. Development was conducted by a team of more than 1,000 people, including Rockstar North's core team and staff from parent company Rockstar Games' studios around the world.Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life. Nine years after a failed robbery in the fictional town of Ludendorff, North Yankton, former bank robber Michael Townley and his family have relocated to Los Santos under a new identity.</p>
